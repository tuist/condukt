  # Pure codec for the Kubernetes WebSocket port-forward wire
  # (`v4.channel.k8s.io` subprotocol, the same channel framing exec
  # uses, GA for port-forward since Kubernetes 1.30 / KEP-4006).
  #
  # Every WebSocket binary message is `<<channel::8, payload::binary>>`.
  # For a single forwarded port the API server uses two channels:
  #
  #   * channel 0 - the data stream (the bytes the pod port read/wrote)
  #   * channel 1 - an error stream (UTF-8 diagnostics, terminal)
  #
  # The API server's first message on each channel is a 2-byte
  # little-endian port number handshake that carries no application
  # payload. `Demux` strips exactly that first prefix per channel and
  # passes everything after through verbatim.
  #
  # This module is intentionally pure: all the protocol risk lives here
  # so it can be exhaustively unit tested without a cluster. The
  # GenServer that owns the socket only does Mint plumbing.
