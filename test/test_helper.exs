# Virtual sandbox tests are tagged `:virtual_sandbox` and excluded by
# default. They rely on the bashkit NIF and run reliably locally, but on
# Linux CI runners merely loading the NIF in the same BEAM process as the
# rest of the suite has reproduced intermittent segfaults during BEAM
# teardown. Until that is root-caused, opt in explicitly:
#
#   mix test --include virtual_sandbox
#
# Or run only the Virtual sandbox suite:
#
#   mix test --only virtual_sandbox
